# loomworks.nvim — Feature Backlog

Items deferred during development. Not prioritized — just collected so
they don't get lost.

---

## Disable navigation keymaps in loomworks UI windows

`<C-o>`, `-` (oil.nvim), and similar global keymaps can navigate away
from loomworks status page, config editors, and other UI windows.
Fixed in loomtest explorer — need same treatment in loomworks View/Tree
widget (view.lua, status.lua).

---

## No-tool profile: MSVC auto-detection metadata

When creating a profile without selecting a tool (no cmake kits detected),
cmake picks MSVC automatically. The resulting build is multi-config but
loomworks metadata (cmake_info.multi_config, tool_data.generator) doesn't
reflect this. Investigate why tool detection didn't offer MSVC and why
cmake_info is wrong after configure.

---

## Overseer template references as launch targets

LaunchTarget currently supports module targets (cmake executables) and
command-type configs (loomworks.json launch section). Could also support
referencing overseer task templates (e.g., from VS Code launch.json)
as launch targets.

## Configuration conflict detection

Detect when two configurations share the same output directory (e.g.,
TypeScript outDir). Warn via confirmation dialog before building a
conflicting configuration. Auto-detect from outDir comparison; optionally
allow explicit conflict declaration in loomworks.json.

## Implicit single-config mapping

If a project has exactly one configuration (e.g., TypeScript's "default"),
the configuration_set could omit it — auto-map to the only option.
Reduces loomworks.json verbosity for simple projects.

## Configuration validation

When parsing loomworks.json, validate that configuration_set mappings
reference configurations the module actually knows about. Show warnings
like "ScenePluginTest: 'production' is not a known configuration".

## Optimize redundant npm install

TypeScript configure (npm install) is per-ConfigUnit but npm install is
project-level (shared node_modules). Could deduplicate by making configure
project-level rather than configuration-level.

## ~~Post-build file copy support~~

**Addressed** (feature/deploy-steps). Implemented as deploy steps on launch
configurations — declarative copy steps that ensure build artifacts are
deployed before launch, with freshness tracking. See specification.md
section 9.8.

## TypeScript LSP integration (tsconfig switching)

Similar to clangd integration for cmake: provide factory functions that
route ts_ls/vtsls to the correct tsconfig per profile. Would need a
`typescript.tsconfig` field per configuration in loomworks.json, and a
`ts_ls_root_dir` factory similar to `clangd_root_dir`. Auto-restart
ts_ls on profile switch when tsconfig changes.

Low priority — most TypeScript projects use a single tsconfig.json.
Only needed when profiles map to different tsconfig files (e.g.,
tsconfig.debug.json vs tsconfig.release.json).

## Tool selection when adding second keyed-module type

When adding a project of a *new* keyed-module type (e.g., meson to a
cmake workspace), existing profiles need a tool selection for the new
module type. The multi-tool data model (profile.tools dict) supports
this, but the UI flow for selecting tools per module type during
add-project is not yet implemented. Currently only single-keyed-module
workspaces are fully handled (tool inherited from existing profiles).

## Clear active profile on deletion

When a profile is deleted, the active_profile in loomworks.user.json
should be cleared if it matches the deleted profile. Currently the
profile is removed from cache but user.json still references it,
leaving a dangling active_profile until the user activates something
else.

## Clean directories per configuration

Allow specifying additional directories to delete when cleaning a
configuration. For example, cmake deploy steps copy DLLs and .node files
to `ScenePluginTest/Debug/` — these should be cleaned when the
configuration is cleaned.

Could be defined in loomworks.json per project:
```json
"ScenePluginTest": {
    "typescript": {},
    "clean_dirs": ["${project_path}/Debug", "${project_path}/Release"]
}
```

Variable expansion (${project_path}, ${config_set}) applies. Directories
are deleted during the clean action alongside module clean_tasks.

## Decouple config_key from variant name

Currently `config_key` is derived from `variant + tool_key` (e.g.,
`"Debug:ninja-gcc-12"`). This makes the variant name load-bearing for
identity — renaming a configuration requires rekeying cache entries,
registry slots, and profile configuration arrays.

Ideally, `config_key` would be a stable opaque ID assigned at creation
(e.g., sequential or UUID). The variant name would be purely a display
label. Rename would then be a simple field update with no rekeying.

This would also align with the architectural principle that keys should
not be used for runtime lookups — only direct object references.

## Modules as domain objects + cache deserialization isolation

Modules are currently stateless function tables loaded via `require`.
Making them domain objects would:

1. **Module domain objects** — Workspace owns Module instances. Each
   module owns its Tool registry. `project._module` replaces
   `project.type` string. `tool._module` replaces `tool.mod_type`
   string. Module-specific logic (cmake task generation, info parsing)
   lives on the module object; generic behavior stays in shared code.

2. **Deserialization layer** — The `_sync_*` methods become the only
   place that does key→object resolution. They resolve every string
   reference from cache/config into domain object references, then
   pass fully-resolved data to `_update()`. After deserialization,
   key→object tables are not accessible to domain objects.

3. **No key lookups in domain objects** — `_update()` receives
   pre-resolved references. `_workspace` back-reference either goes
   away or becomes a narrow interface (no registry access). Domain
   objects navigate only via direct references.

This eliminates the remaining string-based lookups: `find_tool(mod_type,
tool_key)`, `mod_type` strings throughout the codebase, and
`_workspace._projects[key]` during `_update()`. Cache format stays
the same (strings on disk, resolved on load). Object identity
preservation and remerge ordering are unchanged.

Entry point: Module domain objects (wrapping existing function tables).

## Built-in sanitizer/tool configuration templates

Provide pre-built abstract mixin configurations for common development
tools: address sanitizer (asan), thread sanitizer (tsan), undefined
behavior sanitizer (ubsan), memory sanitizer (msan). Users inherit from
these mixins to create concrete configs (e.g., `Debug-asan` inherits
`[Debug, asan]`).

Best starting point is the Meson module — Meson has first-class sanitizer
support via `-Db_sanitize=address` etc., so the mapping is clean. For
cmake, sanitizer flags are compiler-specific (`-fsanitize=` for gcc/clang,
`/fsanitize=` for MSVC) and would need compiler detection to generate
correct options. Defer cmake sanitizer templates until compiler-aware
option generation is available.

## Profile/variable persistence lost after task failure

Observed: after creating a profile or adding variables and triggering a
configure/launch that fails, the data may disappear from user.json or
loomworks.json on a subsequent save. Possibly related to the stuck
operation / remerge interaction, or a save triggered by the failure
path overwriting with stale data. Error logging added to `_save_user`
(2026-04-02) to help diagnose if it recurs.

## Variable/deploy discoverability and documentation in UI

The variable system and deploy steps lack in-editor documentation.
Users need help text or descriptions for:
- Available built-in variables (${workspace_root}, ${build_dir}, etc.)
  and what they expand to
- The difference between ${variant} (cmake variant) and ${configuration}
  (config name from profile mapping)
- Source path is relative to build dir (for path type)
- ${project_path} is relative, use ${workspace_root}/${project_path}
  for absolute
- Variable type meanings (string vs path — path enables segment editor)
Could add tooltips, help text in editors, or a help dialog.

---

## ~~Rename-back shows entry in both profiles and orphaned sections~~

**Fixed** (fix/rename-orphan-accumulation). Root cause: rename used
`_rebuild_profile_projects_for` which destroyed and recreated domain
objects. Fix: pure in-place mutation — Configuration, Profile, ConfigUnit
all keep identity. Old BuildDir orphaned as domain object; rename-back
adopts it. Introduced BuildDir domain object, removed `_last_raw_cache`.

---

## Graceful degradation for external dependencies

Current hard dependencies: **overseer** (build/launch), **snacks** (picker,
explorer window). Soft: fidget (progress), nvim-dap (debug), lualine
(status component).

Issues to address:
- **fidget**: build/deploy progress uses fidget exclusively — if not
  installed, progress is silent. Should fall back to `vim.notify` or
  a minimal echo.
- **snacks**: used for `vim.ui.select`-style pickers and the loomtest
  explorer window (`Snacks.win`). Should fall back to `vim.ui.select` /
  `vim.ui.input` for pickers. Explorer window needs snacks or an
  alternative (floating window API directly).
- **overseer**: core dependency, hard to remove. Document as required.
- Audit all `require()` calls to external modules for pcall guards.
